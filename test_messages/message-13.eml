Emails
To: <philion@seattlecommunitynetwork.org>


Issue #93 <http://10.0.1.20/issues/93#change-137> has been updated by Paul
Philion.
------------------------------


Looking over the redmine source code (
https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/63188014b0c084319839b34e5dffe8a6d35=
1cdd0/app/models/mail_handler.rb#L93)
there doesn't seem any way to hook into the "receive" function with redmine=
.

(also, my Ruby is terrible. if anyone sees a way to do it, please speak up!=
)

However, there is an API hook for the email, as implied by
https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/63188014b0c084319839b34e5dffe8a6d35=
1cdd0/extra/mail_handler/rdm-mailhandler.rb#L152C1-L153C1

Specifically:

/mail_handler

This implies that it should be possible to extend the redmine email
handling by forcing the ticket number onto a subject line for email that
don't have one.

Instead of using the current cron job, a new job would be written to:
1) Grab IMAP email from the specified accounts
2) If the email already has a ticket #, just forward to /mail_hander
3) If no ticket #, lookup sender email (forwarded-by backup), look for most
recent open ticket from that email and add that # to the Subject line, then
forward to /mail_handler
4) If no open tickets, open for that user, forward unchanged email to open
new ticket. (note: verify behavior)

Software Dev Task #93: Threading with Emails

Issue threading does not currently work when tickets are created via emails
that fwded into redmine by copying the support@ email. This is
understandable given that the sender is different and the subject line
doesn't contain the ticket number if it's on an email thread that isn't the
one created by redmine.
We should either figure out how to send emails into redmine "correctly" so
that threading works, or make our fwding scenario work via our code.
